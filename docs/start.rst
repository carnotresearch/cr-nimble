Quick Start
===================

Platform Support
----------------------

``cr-nimble`` can run on any platform supported by ``JAX``. 
We have tested ``cr-nimble`` on Mac and Linux platforms.

``JAX`` is not officially supported on Windows platforms at the moment. 
Although, it is possible to build it from source using Windows Subsystems for Linux.
