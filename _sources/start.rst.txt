Quick Start
===================

Platform Support
----------------------

``cr-nimble`` can run on any platform supported by ``JAX``. 
We have tested ``cr-nimble`` on Mac and Linux platforms.

``JAX`` is not officially supported on Windows platforms at the moment. 
Although, it is possible to build it from source using Windows Subsystems for Linux.


Installation
-------------------------------

Installation from PyPI:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install cr-nimble



Directly from our GITHUB repository:

.. code:: shell

    python -m pip install git+https://github.com/carnotresearch/cr-nimble.git

.. note::

    If you are on Windows, JAX is not yet officially supported.
    However, you can install an unofficial JAX build for windows
    from https://github.com/cloudhan/jax-windows-builder.
    This works quite well for development purposes.
